# Graph Visualizer 🟢🟡

**Interactive visualization of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra algorithms on a graph.**





## Features

* Click any node to select a **start node**.
* Run **BFS**, **DFS**, or **Dijkstra** with live animations.
* Node colors indicate state:

  * 🟡 Yellow → Currently Processing
  * 🟢 Green → Visited / Completed
* **Edges glow** when active.
* **Adjust speed** of animations in real-time with a slider.
* **Reset** the graph anytime to try different start nodes or algorithms.



## How It Works

1. **Select Start Node**
   Click any node (A–E). This node becomes the starting point.

2. **Choose Algorithm**

   * **BFS** → Level order traversal (Queue, FIFO)
   * **DFS** → Depth-first traversal (Stack, LIFO)
   * **Dijkstra** → Shortest path using weighted distances

3. **Watch Animation**
   Nodes and edges are highlighted as the algorithm runs.

4. **Control Speed**
   Adjust the slider to slow down or speed up the visualization.



## Installation / Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/MsRobot05/GraphStudio.git
   
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd GraphStudio
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server needed).
4. Click a node → choose an algorithm → watch the magic!

If you want, I can **also make a version that looks even more “modern GitHub ready” with badges, table of contents, and colored sections**—it will make your project pop immediately.

Do you want me to do that next?
